# how to compile your kernel in manjaro
## this is documentation for the video I posted on youtube discussing how to compile the linux kernel on manjaro. I will go over the commands I ran and why I did what I did
the first step is to update your system i was using manjaro linux the way to do that on manjaro is 

``` sudo pacman -Syu ```

the next thing is to grab the source tarball you can get from git or [the linux kernel site](https://www.kernel.org)
